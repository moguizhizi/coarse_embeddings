This is the supplementary code for paper 'Probabilistic Coarsening for Knowledge Graph Embeddings'.

The code is divided into 3 directories for each of the 3 baseline methods used in our paper. Each directory has their own installation and runtime instructions and are independent, meaning you do not need to install all 3 of them to run any specific one.

Code for RDF2Vec and TransE runs in Python 3.6 and code for R-GCN runs in Python 2.7.

Due to size restrictions, we only included the mutag aifb and bgs dataset meaning that am dataset has to be downloaded separately. To download the am dataset, follow:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/htisydfgwxmrx65/am_stripped.nt.gz?dl=1

Once downloaded, extract and place the am_stripped.nt file in the am directory analogously to the other datasets.

For detailed runtime instructions, read the instructions.txt file in each of the directories.
